**This is the first README.md of the course and it is mandatory in projects.**

- Navigate to your home directory
- Create a directory, in this case it is zero_day
- Initialize git and add remote origin
- Create a file ```README.md``` with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. **This file is mandatory in projects**
- Add this new file to git, commit the change and push to the remote server/origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)

Do all this from the terminal on your computer, especially using Vagrant and VirtualBox
